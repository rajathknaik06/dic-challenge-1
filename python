""" John is a data analyst who often works with text files. He needs a program that can analyze the contents of a text file and count the number of times a specific character appears in the file. 



John wants a simple program that allows him to specify a file and a character to count within that file.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of the file's name to be analyzed.

The second line of the input consists of the string they want to write within the file.

The third line of the input consists of the character to count within the file.

Output format :
If the character is found, the output displays "The character 'X' appears {Y} times in the file." where X is the character and Y i the count,



If the character does not appear in the file, the output displays "Character not found.""""

def count_character_in_file(file_name, character):
    try:
        with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            # Count the character while ignoring case
            count = content.lower().count(character.lower())
            return count
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return -1

# Input: File name, content, and character to count
file_name = input()
content = input()
character_to_count = input()

# Write the content to the file
with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
    file.write(content)

# Count the character in the file
result = count_character_in_file(file_name, character_to_count)

if result == -1:
    print("File not found.")
elif result == 0:
    print("Character not found in the file.")
else:
    print(f"The character '{character_to_count}' appears {result} times in the file.")
